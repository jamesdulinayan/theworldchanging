	<h2>Cooperation</h2>
	<p style="color:white;">A new EU strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation was unveiled recently. The EU accounts for just 7 % of the world population, but it is responsible for 24 % of world expenditure on research, 32 % of high-impact publications and 32 % of patent applications. International c ooperation is seen as a vital step towards homing in on opportunities and further development. <br> <br>

Ideas generated by the diplomatic corps meeting on the new international cooperation strategy involved looking at ways to strengthen excellence in research and innovation by facilitating access to knowledge, people and markets across borders and across the globe. Maintaining a strong focus on firms and innovation, which require a new or different approach between academia and industry and between research and innovation, was also highlighted. Other ideas included strengthening evidence or analysis-based decision-making, and analysing likely trends, future changes and systematic exchange of experiences.</p>
