	<h2>Complexity </h2>
	<p style="color:white;">Complexity  has become influential in recent models in social science. In the context of innovations and new technologies, most applications have focused on technology adoption and technology diffusion, where as the topic of the innovation process has received less attention. This three families of complexity models of technological innovation: fitness landscape models, network models and percolation models. The models are capable of analysing complex interaction structures (between components of technologies, between agents engaged in collective invention) while avoiding ‘over-parameterisation’. The methodological challenges and critiques regarding the application of complexity theory that remain.</p>
