				<h2>Card One 1</h2>
				<p>Do you pick out the clothes you wear to scho ol each day? When you’re deciding what to wear, what do you think about? What things are important to you? If you look in your closet, you realize that you have a certain number of clothes to choose from. But how did those clothes get there? Did you help pick them out? Why did you or your family members choose the clothes you have?</p>

				<p>Fashion refers to the styles of dress that are currently popular. Fashion goes beyond just clothes, though. It can extend to shoes, jewelry, and even how you style your hair.
For some people, fashion is a high priority. They like to wear only the latest fashions and styles. For others, though, keeping up wit h the there  isn’t that important.
And keeping up is certainly something you have to do if fashion is important to you. The one thing that stays the same with fashion is this: It always changes!

				<p>Michael Jackson made parachute pants all the rage. Now try to find these items in today’s clothing stores. It may be pretty difficult!
Why do fashions change? The answer is probably as simple as the fact that people change. Over time, the new replaces the old. People are influenced by popular culture, including athletes, musicians, movie stars, social media, and royalty. They also pay attention to what people wear in popular films, television shows, online videos, books, and music. We also are influenced by the fashion industry’s advertising.

				<h2>Card One 4</h2>
				<p>When people see these new styles, they often want to imitate their favorite stars. To do so, they seek out the latest fashions—clothe s, shoes, jewelry, etc.—to make themselves look like the people they want to be like. In this way, fashions constantly change over time.
This has been happening for hundreds of years! Ever since clothes were invented, they’ve been used as forms of expression. As far back as the 1700s, people in France were known to spend hours looking through fashion magazines to learn about the latest styles. This trend quickly spread across Europe.
For years, clothes have been used to separate people into groups. Even today, expensive brand-name clothing is sometimes used by people to distinguish themselves from others. Unfortunately, this can often have the effect of ostracizing certain groups

				<p>The fashion industry is in the midst of a hyperspeed evolution. 
The novel coronavirus pandemic upended nearly every part of the industry in a matter of weeks, as people followed shelter-in-place orders around the globe — with little desire or need to wear much beyond casual clothing. 
With no guidebook for this unprecedented challenge, many retailers have filed for bankruptcy. Others are seizing opportunities to transform their business-as-usual habits and find new ways of reaching and exciting their customers. They are rethinking the supply chains and processes through which clothing gets made, as well as shifting sales to e-commerce platforms; focusing on what’s now known as “work-from-home” wear; and adjusting store layouts and procedures. 
“We’re going to evolve into what everyone knows is some sort of new normal,” said Pete Nordstrom, President of Nordstrom, in an April panel hosted by Vogue. “We’re going to have to be flexible.”

				<p>now, with the exception of undergarments,” says Allison Pfingst, fashion historian and archivist, and advisor of the Fashion Studies department at Fordham University. A decade after the first electric washer hit the market, very few households had one.
“You can imagine how difficult it would be to do your family's household laundry by hand, especially in the midst of a highly contagious pandemic when you're likely taking care of someone who is ill,” Pfingst says. That pushed delicate or fussy clothing and voluminous undergarments out of women’s closets, bringing in slimmer clothing shapes, sturdy fabrics, and colors that don’t fade in the wash.
Today, as we peel off our “outside” clothes and stick them straight into the washing machine on the ultra-hot sanitary setting, we’ll likely also pivot to easy, washable clothing and away from “dry clean only” fashion. That means cotton, linen, washable silk, and washable merino wool are in. Delicate beadwork and lace, plus fabrics like rayon or regular silk that shrink and stain at the mere sight of water, are out.
Don’t forget that it’s always okay to develop your own sense of style. You can be unique and separate from others in the fashion world. Stay true to yourself and let your personality—not your clothes—speak for who you are!
