				<h2>EMERGING ECONOMIES</h2>
				<p>Emerging markets countries are expected to play a crucial role in international trade and finance as well as to contribute significantly to the global economic growth. Assets issued by emerging financial markets have, over the last three decades, been selected by both individual and professional investors to design dedicated investment portfolio strategies. While it is common that emerging markets can provide substantial diversification benefits at int ernational level, their financial characteristics and links to the global economy tend to be country-specific, owing to an important degree of heterogeneity across these markets in terms of market size, financial depth, and international investment barriers, among others. The global conversation centered around the ability of countries power to innovate in the face of changing times.
