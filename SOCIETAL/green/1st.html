				<h2>GREEN LIVING</h2>
				<p>Green living is a lifestyle that tries in as many ways as it can to bring into balance the conservation and preservation of the Earth's natural resources, habitats, and biodiversity with human culture and communities. Eco design is both a principle and an approach. It consists of integrating environm ental protection criteria over a service or a product’s lifecycle. The main goal of eco design is to anticipate and minimize negative environmental impacts (of manufacturing, using and disposing of products). Nonetheless, nowadays, because of the environmental and social problems societies around the world are facing, sustainability has been increasingly used in a specific way. Nowadays, sustainability is usually defined as the processes and actions through which humankind avoids the depletion of natural resources, in order to keep an ecological balance that doesn’t allow the quality of life of modern societies to decrease.</p>
