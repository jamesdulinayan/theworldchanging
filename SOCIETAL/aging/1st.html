				<h2>AGING POPULATION</h2>
				<p>Population aging is the 21st ce ntury's dominant demographic phenomenon. Declining fertility, increasing longevity, and the progression of large-sized cohorts to the older ages are causing elder shares to rise throughout the world. The phenomenon of population aging, which is unprecedented in human history, brings with it sweeping changes in population needs and capacities, with potentially significant implications for employment, savings, consumption, economic growth, asset values, and fiscal balance. Thus far, we have limited our discussion to the annual effects of aging and population growth, without relating these factors to the issue of most concern to policymakers: the current and future rise in total costs. To give a sense of the relative importance of our results, we calculate the contribuation of aging and population growth to the overall rise in spending at one point in time..</p>
