				<h2>FAST LIVING</h2>
				<p>To live a fast life means to be reckless. To be spontaneous to the point of never thinking anything through to the end before doing it. People nowadays tend to choose to live a convenient or easy life , they are living fast, they even prefer convenient foods over home cooked because it's much easier. Convenience foods include ready-to-eat dry products, frozen foods such as TV dinners, shelf-stable foods, prepared mixes such as cake mix, and snack foods. Eating unhealthy food may cause obesity and these kind of food does not guarantee our safety.</p>
