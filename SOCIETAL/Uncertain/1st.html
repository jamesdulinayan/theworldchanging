				<h2>UNCERTAIN TIMES</h2>
				<p>It is not surprising that we are inclined to reduce uncertainty given its negative impacts. Uncertainty is linked to increased stress, role ambiguity, job turnover, negative health effects and poor decision making. Uncertainty can lead to poor performance and people often define their meaning and worth through their performance. As such, we can be left searching for meaning in uncertain times. For a generation of business leaders, we have been operating in and living through what we believed wer e uncertain times. Continual upheavals, disruptions and global shifts like digitization, technology transformation, changing geopolitics, evolving business models, and a changing consensus on globalization and trade have for decades challenged the very notion of executive decision-making. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, is changing–or has already changed–our collective calculus of uncertainty because there is no reference case for the COVID-19 crisis in living memory. Transparency” is government’s obligation to share information with citizens that is needed to make informed decisions and hold officials accountable for the conduct of the people’s business especially now that we are experiencing a crisis. Transparency exists on government websites largely at the munificence of officials.</p>
