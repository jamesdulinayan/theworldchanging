		<h2>VISUALIZATION</h2>
		<p>Today, “visualization” refers to the innovative use of images and interactive technology to explore large, high-density datasets. Through multi-touch interfaces, mobile device views, and social network communities, many organizations are able to see, explore, and share relationships and insigh ts in new ways. But visualization has deep roots going back to society’s earliest maps, scientific charts, and instructional illustrations – many designed to convey complex information in ways that simplify, communicate, and foster understanding. In computer science, visualization has been attempted for decades, but has been limited by graphical horsepower, CPU, memory, and storage constraints.</p>
