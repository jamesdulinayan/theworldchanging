		<h2>BIOTECHNOLOGY</h2>
		<p>Technology that uses living organisms to make products - could soon allow us to conjure up products as diverse as household cleaning products, organs for transplant and cleaner renewable fuels. For people who are not familiar with biotechnologies, what are they and how do they impact our lives? Biotechnology is a broad range of technologies that employ living organisms or parts of them to make diverse products. For example, drugs and therapeutics, nutritional compounds, environmentally friendly chemicals and materials, biofuels, and novel functional materials can be produced through biotechnology.</p>
