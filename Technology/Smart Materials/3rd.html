		<h2>SMART MATERIALS</h2>
		<p>Engineered materials that sense and react to environmental conditions or have properties that can be altered in a controlled fashion by light, temperature, moisture, mechanical force, or electric or magnetic fields. All changes are reversible, given that the materials return to their original states once the external stimulus expires. It can change the world by helping people to do less works and to do chores with less effort.</p>
